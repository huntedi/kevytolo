Disobey 2024:

Sergey Ichtchenko shares his personal experience as a cybersecurity enthusiast in his talk at Disobey 2024 Conference. After encountering a vulnerability and reporting it to a company, he received positive encouragement instead of legal threats. That supportive response was a turning point in his career. Ichtchenko emphasizes that parents and corporations should foster young people's cybersecurity skills through positive actions such as rewards and opportunities. He warns that negative feedback can drive individuals towards cybercrime.

**a) Bandit oh-five**

I successfully completed the first levels 0-4 of the OverTheWire Bandit game. Below is a screenshot of level 5.

**b) Can't fish.**

Using the command _ping_ , I tested connectivity between my computer (@miau) and Cloudflare's (1.1.1.1) and Google's (8.8.8.8) DNS servers by sending Internet Control Message Protocol echo requests. Each output line shows a response from target IPs, including the size of the packet (64 bytes per line), the sequence number (ranging from 1-4), time to live and the round-trip time in milliseconds.

All eight packets transmitted and received successfully with zero percent packet loss, indicating my system has an active network connectivity with the DNS servers.

I disconnected my computer's Ethernet cable and then ran the ping command again. For both pings to 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8, the output showed lines indicating that the destination host is unreachable. The packet statistics confirm that zero responses were received from the target servers, and each ping resulted in errors with 100% packet loss. This confirms that no packets reached their destination, indicating that my network interface is disconnected.

**c) Local only.**

I ran the command _sudo nmap -A localhost_. 

_sudo_ ran the command with admin privileges to access all scanning capabilities. _nmap_ is the tool used. _-A_ tells Nmap to perform an aggressive scan. _localhost_ refers to my computer on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) meaning the scan is performed on my local machine. 

Breaking down the output:

**Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-09-05 13:06 EEST:**

This line shows the version of Nmap being used (7.93) and the time the scan was started.



**Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1):**

Nmap reports the result of the scan on my local machine, which has the address 127.0.0.1.



**Host is up (0.000016s latency):**

This indicated that my machine is active and responds back to the scan with a very low latency which tells that the response time is quick.



**All 1000 scanned ports on localhost (127.0.0.1) are in ignored states:**

Nmap performed scan on the 1000 most common TCP ports. They are ignored indicating Nmap didn't find anything in open state.



**Not shown: 1000 closed tcp ports (reset):**

This line clarifies that all 1000 ports scanned are closed. 



**Too many fingerprints match this host to give specific OS details:**

Nmap could not identify the OS details. 



**Network Distance: 0 hops:**

There is no network distance between Nmap and the target, which confirms that I was scanning my local machine.



**OS and Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/:**

This line is a generic message asking user to report errors during the detection.



**Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.05 seconds:**

This line shows that the scan was successful, scanning my local machine's IP adddress and finished in just over two seconds. 




In conclusion, the Nmap aggressive scan on my computer revealed that there was no open ports among the 1000 most commonly scanned ones. The scan confirmed that the machine is local with no network distance involved. This result aligns with expectations for a machine with no open ports and confirms that the scanning process was limited to the local environment.

**d) Daemon.**

I installed the Apache 2 web server using the command _sudo apt-get -y install apache2_ and started it with _sudo service start apache2_. The output was _Starting Apache httpd web server: apache2_ which indicates that the service is running. Then I disconnected my internet. 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bdcd49-94ef-4ab1-83a9-f3a259d07540)

I ran the Nmap scan again on localhost (127.0.0.1) using the same version of Nmap (7.93). The scan without the daemon showed that all 1000 scanned ports were closed. However, the scan with the daemon revealed that port 80/tcp was open and running Apache HTTP server version 2.4.62 on Debian. It also provided additional details about the operating system, identifying it as Linux 2.6.32. Both scans confirmed that the target was local, with a network distance of 0 hops. The scan with the daemon took longer due to the extra time required for the detailed service and OS detection.
