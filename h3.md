**b) Can't fish.**

Using the command _ping_ I tested connectivity between my computer (@miau) and Cloudfare's (1.1.1.1) and Google's (8.8.8.8) DNS servers by sending Internet Control Message Protocol echo requests. Each output lines shows a response from target IPs, including the size of the packet (64 bytes per line), the sequence number (ranging from 1-4), time to live and the round-trip time in milliseconds.

All eight packets transmitted and received pack succesfuly with zero percent packet loss, indicating my system has a active network connectivity to DNS servers.
