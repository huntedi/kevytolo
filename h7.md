**7 Things You Should Know About Tor.**

The article debunks some common misconceptions about the Tor network. 

**1. Still works:** Attacks typically exploit user errors rather than breaking the Tor network itself.

**2. Not only for criminals:** Tor is widely used by many types of people seeking privacy and protection online.

**3. No military backdoor:** Tor is open source, and there is no military backdoor, even though it was initially funded by the US Navy.

**4. Legal in the US:** No one in the US has been prosecuted for running a Tor relay. 

**5. Easy to use:** Simple and quick to set up with Tor Browser or Tails OS. 

**6. Not as slow as believed:** Tor's performance has been improved, and nowadays it offers decent speeds.

**7. Not foolproof**: To maintain anonymity, Tor must be used correctly.

**The Tor Browser**

**Introduction**

  * Tor is browser modified from Mozilla Firefox that hides users' true IP addresses to enable anonymity.
  * It is user-friendly and does not require technical skills for private online activity.

**History and intended use of the onion router**

  * Maintained globally by community of people.
  * As an open-source protect, anyone can contribute to its improvement. 

**How the onion router works**

  * Routes user traffic through multiple random relay nodes which adds layers of encryption at each stage. 
  * Sending data over Tor is like peeling an onion; a layer of encryption is removed as it progresses through the network. 

**Tracking criminals using Tor**

  * While Tor is effective, its users can be identified due to human errors.

**a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). **

I downloaded Tor browser to my Windows PC from the torproject.com Downloads section. After downloading the Windows installation file, I double-clicked the .exe file to start the installation progress.

The installation wizard opened, and I selected English as the language. I chose a destination folder and proceede with the installation as the files were extracted. Once the setup was complete, I selected the option to Run Tor Browser.
