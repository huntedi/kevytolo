**One-way functions**

  * Fundamental part in cryptography protocols.
  * These function are easy to compute but "impossible" to reverse.

Trapdooor one-way function

  * These functions follows the idea of one-way function.
      * They include a secret that allows computation in the reverse direction.

**One-way hash functions**

Tranforms a variable-lenght input string (pre-image) into a fixed-lenght output string (hash value), which is usually smaller in size. 

  * One-directional: It is easy to compute a hash value from a pre-image but hard the other way around. 
  * Collision free: It is hard to generate two pre-images that procudde the same hash value.
  
Message authentication code (MAC)

  * One-way hash function with a secret key.
  * The resulting hash value is a function of both the input data image and the secret key.

**a) Install Hashcat.**

  I installed Hashcat with

  
  _sudo apt-get update_
  
  _sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat_
  

  I already had wget installed.

  

Then I made new directory and went there.

  _mkdir hashed_
  
  _cd hashed_

I downloaded Rockyou dictionary using wget and cracked the hash.

1. Cracking the hash

After that, I checked the result in solved file and found out the pre-image was "summer".

2. Hash cracked

**b) Crack this hash**

I used the same command as in a) to crack this hash.

3. Cracking the hash pt. 2

Again, I looked at the solved file to find that the pre-image was this time "disobey".

4. Solved
