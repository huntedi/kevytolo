**h2 Kill chain**

**x) Read and summarize.**

Advanced persistent threats

•	Attackers use highly cultivated customized malware and zero-day exploits that are undetectable by traditional antivirus solutions. These attacks are usually targeting sensitive information for significant economic or military benefits. 

Intelligence driven computer network defence

•	Strategy involving a profound on understanding of attackers’ tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to anticipate and mitigate future intrusions. It requires evolving analysis, processes and technology to manage the threat component of risk not only the vulnerabilities. 

Kill chain model

•	Intelligence driven, threat focused approach that studies intrusions from the attackers’ perspective. Defenders use the model to develop resilient mitigations, by aiming to disrupt any stage of the chain, as the attacker must progress through each stage of the chain to achieve their object, meaning that interrupting any stage will stop the entire attack. 

Phases of the kill chain
1.	Reconnaissance: research, identification and selection of targets using public sources such as websites and social media.
2.	Weaponization: linking remote access trojan with an exploit, often embedding it in commonly used file formats like PDFs or Microsoft Office documents.
3.	Delivery: transmission of the weaponized payload to the targeted environment through email attachments, websites and USB removable media. 
4.	Exploitation: triggering the malicious code on the victims’ system by exploiting vulnerabilities 
5.	Installation: installing malware on the victim system, allowing constant access 
6.	Command and Control (C2): establishing a communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker’s server
7.	Actions on objectives: only after progressing through the first six phases, attackers execute their goals, such as data retreating or further system compromises

•	Preservation of experienced staff within a company or organization can significantly enhance threat detection and management. Employees who have been with a company for an extended period develop a deep understanding of its systems and processers. This familiarity enables them to spot differences and potential threats more effectively than newer employees who might lack this context. This raised the question of what strategies companies use to keep employees satisfied, especially since yearly raises are less attractive compared to the salary increases offered by new employers. 

**a)	Bookworm**

_The configurations and settings described below are specific to my system and preferences. You may need to make different selections during the installation process depending on your hardware and requirements._

Firstly, I read through Karvinen’s instructions on how to install Debian (Karvinen, 2023). Using the link in the instructions I downloaded Debian-live-12.6.0-amd64-xfce.iso file.  I already had VirtualBox installed, but if you do not, I suggest googling on how to download VirtualBox. Then I opened VirtualBox and selected _New_ to create a new virtual machine. Here are the configurations I made in the selection panel: 

Name: DebianTeroKarvinenCom, type: Linux, version: Debian 64-bit, ISO image: Debian-live-12.6.0-amd64-xfce.iso file, system base memory: 4000 MB, virtual hard disk, 60 gigabytes in VDI format.

Figure 1. Summary of the configurations

I double-clicked on my newly created virtual machine to boot it. From the selection panel I chose “Live system (amd64)”. After that the Debian desktop appeared, indicating a successful boot. To test the functionality of almost everything I opened terokarvinen.com on my browser.

Figure 2. Everything working!

From the bottom left corner of the desktop, I clicked _Install Debian._ Here are my installation configurations: 

Language: American English, region: Finland, keyboard layout: Generic 105-key PC with Finnish (Windows), partitions: erase disk, no encryption, master boot record, user account: my full name, login name: my first name, computer name: virtualbox, password: I generated a strong password using Bitwarden. 

I reviewed the summary of all the configurations and confirmed they were correct, then clicked _Install._

After a while the installation was complete, the login screen appeared. I logged in using my credentials.

**b) Voluntary bonus**

I opened terminal and ran the following commands to update the system, install and enable the firewall:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade

sudo apt-get -y install ufw

Figure 4. Configurations done in terminal

To finalize the update, I logged out from clicking _Applications_ and restarted the virtual machine. Finally, I logged in again and now the installation was successfully completed.
