**Threat modeling**
Involves analyzing representations of a system to identify concerns related to security and privacy characteristics. In summary, it requires modeling a system from a security perspective, identifying applicable threats based on that model, and determining responses to those threats. This process should begin during the design phase and continue to be maintained, updated and refined alongside the system. The four questions below are the foundation. (Braiterman et al, 2020)

1.	What are we working on?
2.	What can go wrong?
3.	What are we going to do about it?
4.	Did we do a good enough job?

The advantages of threat modeling include identifying risks early-on, increased security awareness and improvised understanding of the system through tools like data flow diagrams (DFD) and brainstorming. Once we understand what we are working on, only then we can consider what could go wrong. We can use STRIDE to locate threats and META to develop a response for each of the threats. (OSWAP Cheat Sheets Series Team, 2021)

•	Mitigate = take action to reduce the likelihood of that the threat will materialize

•	Eliminate = simply remove the feature or component that is causing the threat

•	Transfer = shift responsibility to another entity such as the customer

•	Accept = do not do any of the above because no options are acceptable given requirements or constraints

After that we ask the question of “did we do a good enough job?”, for example we can use the help of the questions below. 

•	Does the DFD accurately reflect the system?

•	Have all threats been identified?

•	For each identified threat, has a response strategy been agreed upon?

**Information Security Scene**
I listened to Darknet Diaries episode 116: MAD DOG, which featured an interview with a former CIA officer. The episode provided insight into the world of espionage shedding light on high-stake-operations, adversaries and tactics. It made me think of the role of SUPO, which plays a vital role in detecting and preventing espionage here in Finland.

a)	Security hygiene

•	Set up strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication. 
•	Keep all software, devices, and systems up to date. 
•	Frequently back up files, both physically and online. 
•	Encrypt sensitive data. 
•	Use firewalls and VPNs. 
•	Think twice before sharing personal information, avoid untrustworthy websites and links. 
•	Before opening, check the sender of an email or text message. 
•	Regularly evaluate if security strategies are in place or in need of an update.

1)	What are we working on?

AJ is an animation company working in creating animated short films. Our crown jewels include: 
•	film project files: animation files, storyboards, scripts, voice acting and final edited versions of our films
•	intellectual property: animation techniques, character designs and original story ideas.

From the customer's perspective, the primary touchpoints with AJ are:
•	customer portal: for accessing work-in-progress and final deliverables
•	email/communications: for updates and discussion

To maintain customer satisfaction and ensure continued business, AJ needs to:
•	deliver high-quality work on time
•	maintain project confidentiality
•	ensure clear communication

We achieve this by delivering projects on schedule, continuously innovating and refining our creative process to exceed customer expectations, protecting files to prevent leaks and keeping communication channels open and clear, updating our customers regularly with project progress, timelines and with any potential issues.

2)	What could go wrong? 

Using the STRIDE model, potential threats include:
Spoofing = an attacker steals legitimate credentials to impersonate an employee. 
Tampering = an attacker makes changes to project files. 
Repudiation = an attacker manipulates logs to cover their actions. 
Information disclosure = an attacker gains access to confidential data. 
Denial of Service = an attacker floods the servers with traffic.  
Elevation of privilege = an attacker gains an employee role.

(OSWAP Cheat Sheets Series Team, 2021) 

Using expected value, which is based on the probability of the risk occurring and its potential monetary impact, AJ can prioritize the risks. 
To keep AJ’s business thriving, we need customers to trust us. Therefore, for AJ the highest priority risk is:

•	Information disclosure: Protecting our customer data as well as our intellectual property is critical. While the probability of information disclosure is only medium-high, the potential impact on the other hand is very high, which results in a very high expected value, putting information disclosure as our highest priority risk. 

The second highest priority risk is:

•	Denial of Service: to meet deadlines, AJ needs its servers up and running around the clock. A Denial-of-Service attack could disrupt critical operations, leading to missed deadlines and so on potential financial losses. While the probability of a DoS attack is lower than information disclosure, the impact on business is substantial, making it a high-priority risk. 

AJ has one specific threat actor. As an animation studio, AJ can be targeted by industry-specific threats: competitors or entities interested in intellectual property. Known tactics, techniques and procedures are phishing, ransomware and insider threats. As for capability, opportunity and intent, attackers targeting AJ probably possess a medium level of skill, opportunities for cyber attacks arise when we rely on digital assets and intent behind these attacks could range from financial gain to competitive advantage. 

3)	What are we going to do about it?
   
•	Reduce the attack surface by removing unnecessary services and software.
•	Implement two-factor authentication of all accounts to limit unauthorized access.
•	Use firewalls and VPNs to protect against external threats. 
•	Ensure that data access is verified.
•	Transfer risk by negotiating an insurance policy to cover potential financial losses.
•	Accept that some level of risk will always remain but commit to ongoing reviews and improvements to minimize it. 

4) Did we do a good enough job?
   
AJ’s efforts to reduce potential entry points should decrease the potential of successful attacks. The use of two-factor authentication and strict access control are practices that will enhance security. We are well-prepared to detect and to respond to threats quickly. We know that security is not a one-time effort but an ever-going process. We are committed to regular reviews and updates, so we remain responsive to any new vulnerabilities. Overall, we can conclude that we’ve done a good job.
