OWASP: OWASP 10 2021


**A01 Broken Access Control**


Access controls enforce policies that dictate what user can or cannot do. When incorrectly configured, they can lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of data. 

Common vulnerabilities are:

  * Elevation of privilege: acting as an admin or acting as a user without being logged in.
    
  * Manipulation of metadata: tampering with cookies. 

  * Force browsing: Accessing pages without proper credentials.

  * Bypass of access control checks: modifying the URL or the HTML page to gain access. 

Access control is only effective in trusted server-side code, where the attacker cannot modify the access control check or metadata. You can prevent with these steps: 

 * Deny by default except for public resources.

 * Log failures and alert admins when repeated failures occur.

(OWASP Broken Access Control, 2021)



**A05 Security Misconfiguration**


Nowadays software configurations are more customizable increasing the margin for error. 

An application might be vulnerable if:

 * It has unnecessary features installed and enabled.

 * Default accounts and their passwords are enabled and unchanged.

 * The latest security features are disabled.

 * The security settings in the application framework or servers are misconfigured.
  
 * The software is outdated or vulnerable.

To prevent this, implement secure installation processes, such as:

 * Repeatable automated processes to set up a new secure environment and to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings. 

 * Maintaining a minimal platform without unnecessary parts, unused features or frameworks.



(OWASP Security Misconfiguration, 2021)




**A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components Security**

Just like software, components can also become outdated or vulnerable over time. 

Common vulnerabilities include:

 * Not knowing the versions of all components in use.

 * Using unsupported or outdated software. 

 * Not regularly scanning for vulnerabilities or subscribing to bulletins related to components in use.

 * Failing to apply patches regularly.
  
 * Not testing the compatibility of libaries.

 * Not securing component configurations.
   

To prevent this, there should be a patch management process in place: 

 * Remove unused components. 

 * Inventory both client- and server-side components regularly.


(OSWAP Vulnerable And Outdated Components, 2021) 



**A03 Injection**

Injection occurs when untrusted data is sent to a code interpreter as part of a query or command. Most common injections are SQL and noSQL.

Vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is being improperly handled, such as:

 * User-supplied data is not sanitized by the application.

 * Source code reviews or automated testing are not conducted. 


Preventing injection requires keeping data seperate from commands and queries.

 * Use a safe API, which avoids using the interpreter.

 * Use SQL controls withing queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of injection.

a) Goat

I  installed WebGoat succesfully.



b)  F12. Solve Webgoat 2023.4: General: Developer tools.

WebGoats task 4 was about using browser developer tools, specifically through the console and the network tabs.

Step 4 required me to run the JavaScript function _webgoat.customjs.phoneHome()_ via the browser's console and capture the output. To solve this, I opened the Firefox console by pressing F12, entered the function to the console and pressed Enter. The console returned a reponse, which I then copied and pasted into the task field.

1. Webgoat console exercise.

Step 6 required to explore the Network tab and locate a specific HTTP request to extract a value called networkNum. I navigated to the Network tab and examined the various HTTP requests. Most were labeled with generic names like lessonmenu, but one request named network caught my attention. After opening the request, I found the field labeled networkNum and copied it into the task field.

2. WebGoat network tab exercise.

c) Outdated.

I updated all software in Debian I entered the commands:

_sudo apt-get update_ 

_sudo apt-get dist-upgrade_

After completing the updates, I rebooted my virtual machine using the command:

_reboot_


d) Sequel. Solve SQLZoo:


0 SELECT basics.



1. Introducing the world table of countries

The task was to modify the query to show the population of Germany instead of France. To do this, I modified the query's WHERE clause to spell Germany instead of France.



2. Scandinavia

The task was to modify the query to show the name and population for Sweden, Norway and Denmark. To do this, I replaced Brazil, Russia and India in the IN clause with Sweden, Norway and Denmark and also removed China. 

3. Just the right size

The task was to modify the query to show countries with an area between 200 000 and 250 000 square kilometres. To do this I changed the BETWEEN clause from 250000 and 300000 to 200000 and 250000. 

(Select basics, 2024)



2 SELECT from World, from first two subtasks.

1. Introduction

This task was an introduction to the exersices. To solve the task, I read the notes and observed the result of running the SQL command _SELECT name, continent, population FROM world_. 

2. Large Countries

This task was to modify the query to show the names for the countries where the population is at least 200 million. To solve this task, I changed the WHERE clause from = 64105700 to >= 200000000.

e) Johnny tables. Solve Portswigger Labs.

This task was to perform a SQL injection to display hidden data via exploiting the vulnerability in the product category filter. To solve this task, I modified the category parameter in the URL. I added Gifts ' OR 1=1 -- to the end of the URL to create always-true condition which bypasses the released filter and was able to display the unreleased products.
