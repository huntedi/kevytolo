A01 Broken Access Control


Access controls enforces policies which tell what user can or cannot do. Incorrectly configured can lead to unauthoriazed information disclosure, modification and destruction of data. 
Common vulnerabilities are:

  * Elevation of privilege: acting as a admin or acting as a user without being logged in.
    
  * Manipulation of metadata: tampering with cookies

  * Force browsing: finding pages without credits to use those pages

  * Bypass of access control checks: via modifying the URL or the HTML page
