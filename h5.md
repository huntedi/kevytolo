x) Read and summarize (This subtask x does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like) 

Confidentiality - sending a message securely to the receiver

Authentication - receiver needs to be sure of the message's origin.

Integrity - receiver needs to verify that the message has not been modified in delivery

Nonrepudiation - a sender cannot falsely deny that he sent a message

**Cryptosystem**

We have a message (M) than can be in any format. That is called a plaintext (P) and we want to hide with encryption (E) key (K1). After hiding it we have ciphertext (C) and lastly we turn it back into readable format using decryption (D) key (K2).

1. Cryptosystem

Two types of key-based algorithms

1. Symmetric algorithms

* The encryption key can be calculated from the decryption key and vice versa.
* The sender and the receiver must agree on a key to communicate securely.
* The communication is secret as long as the key remains a secret.

2. Public-key algorithms

* Two different keys that cannot be calculated from each other. 
* Encryption key is called public key and decryption key is called private key.
* Anyone can use the public key to encrypt but only the person with private key can decrypt the message. 


**The whole point of grytogprahy is to keep the plaintext, key or the both secret from adversaries.**

Cryptanalysis - science of recovering the plaintext of a message without access to the key

Compromise - loss of a key through noncryptanalytic means

Attack - attempted cryptanalysis

If an algorith cannot be broken with knowledge of how it works, it certainly cannot be breakble without that knowledge. The best algorithms are the ones that have been made public and have been attacked for years, and are still unbreakable. 

Different types of attacks

1. Ciphertext-only attack

a) Pretty Good indeed. Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)
b) Password manager, open and cloudless. Choose a password manager that 1) works without cloud 2) is free, open source sofware. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.
