x) Read and summarize 

Cryptography is the art and science of keeping messages secure. Its key concepts are:

* Confidentiality - ensuring that a message is securely sent and only accessible by the intended receiver. 

* Authentication - The receiver needs to be sure of the message's origin.

* Integrity - The receiver needs to verify that the message has not been modified in delivery.

* Nonrepudiation -The sender cannot falsely deny having sent the message.

**Cryptosystem**

In a cryptosystem, we start with a message (M) that can be in any format, also known as plaintext (P). To protect the message, we can use an encryption key (K1) in a process called encryption (E) which transforms the plaintext into ciphertext (C). Now the ciphertext can be sent securely, and the receiver can turn it back into a readable format using a decryption key (K2) in the process called decryption (D).

1. Cryptosystem


**Two types of key-based algorithms**
1. Symmetric algorithms

* The encryption and decryption keys are identical or can be calculated from one another.
* Both the sender and the receiver must agree on a key to communicate securely.
* The message remains secure as long as the key remains a secret.

2. Public-key algorithms

* Uses two different keys that cannot be calculated from each other. 
* Encryption key is called public key and decryption key is called private key.
* Anyone can use the public key to encrypt but only the person with private key can decrypt the message. 

**Core principles**

The primary goal of cryptography is to keep the plaintext, key or both secret from adversaries. 

* Cryptanalysis - The study of methods for recovering the plaintext of a message without access to the key.

* Compromise - loss of a key through noncryptanalytic methods. 

* Attack - any attempt to perform cryptanalysis. 

If an algorithm cannot be broken with knowledge of how it works, it certainly cannot be breakable without that knowledge. The strongest algorithms are those that have been publicly tested and remain unbroken after years of testing. 

Algorithms have different degrees of security, others are harder to break, costing more. The cost to break an encryption should exceed the value of the data it protects.

**GPG**

GNU privacy guard (gpg) allows users to:

* Encrypt message to ensure privacy.
* Sign messages to protect against modification.
* Use public keys to establish trust without physical meetings. 

 Guide to using GPG: 
 
1. Install required tools on Linux command line

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

2. Creating the keypairs

* gpg --gen-key

3. Exchange of the public keys

* gpg --export --armor --output filename

3. Verification process

* gpg --sign-key id

4. Sending process

* gpg --encrypt -- receipient email --sign

5. Decryption

* gpg --decrypt filename

a) Pretty Good indeed. 

I simulated encrypted communication between Ring and Bling using GPG.

First I downloaded GPG using commands

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gpg


I started with creating a new directory called gpg_work and two subdirectories for Bling and Ring.

2. Directories

Then in Ring's directory, I created key command gpg --homedir . --gen-key

3. Ring's public key


I switched to Bling's directory using cd ../bling and generated their ke using the same command.

4. Bling's public key

After that I modified directory permission to access them both.

5. Permissions

Now that I had both Ring's and Bling's keys I exported them to one other.

6. Export

Then I imported each other's public key.

7. Import

I verified the authenticity of the imported keys and signed them to establish trust.

8. Ring signing Bling's key

9. Bling signing Ring's key

Then in Ring's directory I created a message file and encrypted it for Bling, signing it with Ring's private key.

10. Message

From Ring's directory I copied the encrypted message into Bling's directory. Bling decrypted the message and verified the signature.

11. Decryption


**b) Password manager, open and cloudless.**

I have been using the Bitwarden password manager for many years, but for this exercise, I downloaded KeePass on my Debian system. The installation process was easy; on the command line, I typed the command sudo apt-get install keepass2. Then I launched it from my applications.

From the top left, I selected "File" and then "New" to create a new database where all my data will be stored.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c6591eb-6c74-4328-8ccc-2f16082ec174)
12. Database

Right-clicking the database allows the user to create new entries, where you can enter the title, username, password, URL, and notes. I think it’s great that it shows the quality of the password in bits and in colors which helps making them secure. By clicking the button on the "Repeat" tab, you can open the password generator to create strong and unique passwords.

With KeePass, you can keep the database on the disk or on a USB stick, so it’s always with you. I think it's fantastic feature to have the ability to choose where your date resides. I also tested the autofill function, adding a new entry for GitHub, copied the entry, and went to github.com, where it autofilled my information quickly. 

Everyone should use a password manager, for me its Bitwarden; for others. it can be Keepass. I like that Bitwarden can be accessible from many devices at the same time for example on my PC as an application, on my browser as a extension etc. In all passwords managers help making sure you are on the right side by their autofill feature. Their generators make it easy to have strong passwords which are harder to crack using bruteforce attacks comparing to reusable or easily guessed ones.
