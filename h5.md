x) Read and summarize 

Cryptography is the art and science of keeping messages secure. Its key concepts are:

* Confidentiality - ensuring that a message is securely sent and only accessible by the intended receiver. 

* Authentication - The receiver needs to be sure of the message's origin.

* Integrity - The receiver needs to verify that the message has not been modified in delivery.

* Nonrepudiation -The sender cannot falsely deny having sent the message.

**Cryptosystem**

In a cryptosystem, we start with a message (M) than can be in any format, also known as plaintext (P). To protect the message, we can use an encryption key (K1) in a process called encryption (E) which transforms the plaintext into ciphertext (C). Now the ciphertext can be sent securely, and the receiver can turn it back into a readable format using a decryption key (K2) in the process called decryption (D).

**Two types of key-based algorithms**
1. Symmetric algorithms

* The encryption and decryption keys are identical or can be calculated from one another.
* Both the sender and the receiver must agree on a key to communicate securely.
* The message remains secure as long as the key remains a secret.

2. Public-key algorithms

* Uses two different keys that cannot be calculated from each other. 
* Encryption key is called public key and decryption key is called private key.
* Anyone can use the public key to encrypt but only the person with private key can decrypt the message. 

**Core principles**

The primary goal of cryptography is to keep the plaintext, key or both secret from adversaries. 

* Cryptanalysis - The study of methods for recovering the plaintext of a message without access to the key.

* Compromise - loss of a key through noncryptanalytic methods. 

* Attack - any attempt to perform cryptanalysis. 

If an algorithm cannot be broken with knowledge of how it works, it certainly cannot be breakable without that knowledge. The strongest algorithms are those that have been publicly tested and remain unbroken after years of testing. 

Algorithms have different degrees of security, others are harder to break, costing more. The cost to break an encryption should exceed the value of the data it protects.

GNU privacy guard (gpg) allows users to:

* Encrypt message to ensure privacy.
* Sign messages to protect against modification.
* Use public keys to establish trust without physical meetings. 

 Guide to using GPG: 
 
1. Install required tools on Linux command line

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

2. Creating the keypairs

* gpg --gen-key

3. Exchange of the public keys

* gpg --export --armor --output filename

3. Verification process

* gpg --sign-key id

4. Sending process

* gpg --encrypt -- receipient email --sign

5. Decryption

* gpg --decrypt filename

a) Pretty Good indeed. Encrypt and decrypt a message with 'gnupg', using PGP public key cryptography. (Note that here you learn each step; for end users, you can often automate and make it look simple)

I started with creating a new directory called gpg_testing

mkdir gpg_testing

Then I installed gpg using commands

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gpg

I navigated to gpg_testing directory

cd gpg_testing

i generated keypair using

gpg --gen-key

i typed my information my name, my email addres and passphrase to protect it. then i got my public key

At this point I made the text file, that I will encrypt.

nano secret.txt

3. Message

then i created new directory for the other party, lets call them Mr. B

mkdir mr_b

b) Password manager, open and cloudless. Choose a password manager that 1) works without cloud 2) is free, open source sofware. Install it. Demonstrate its use. Explain why a password manager is needed i.e. what kind of attacks or threats it protects against.
